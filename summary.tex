\begin{frame}{Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We provided a \alert{uniform approach to ASP solving}, allowing for a
    transparent \alert{technology transfer from CP and SAT}
  \item The idea is to view ASP inferences as \alert{unit propagation on nogoods},
    reflecting \alert{constraints} from program rules, unfounded sets, and conflicts
  \item We have provided a \alert{conflict-driven algorithm for ASP} solving, using
    state-of-the-art SAT solving techniques
  \item Our approach \alert{favors local propagation} on explicit nogoods over unfounded
    set checks, which explicate inherent loop nogoods that give rise to unit
    propagation
  \item Our empirical results show that our ASP solver \alert{\clasp{} is competitive}
    with and sometimes superior to existing ASP solvers
  \end{itemize}
